# lumen-mico
Are slowly flashing colourful lights and screens sleep inducing? lumen mico tries to prove that to be so

## Concept
I have seen and experienced falling in front of a tv to be a common thing, if you take a few steps back and see someone getting sleepy by the tv, and you look at the walls you will start to see a certain pattern in the flashing colors. This inspired me to create an algithm to construct a series of colorful light flashes (and other people speaking) to induce sleep.
